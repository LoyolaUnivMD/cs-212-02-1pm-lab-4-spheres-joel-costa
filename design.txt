import Scanner
Initialize Sphere class
    Initialize new Scanner named question
    Create double variables for x, y, z, and radius.
    Create default constructor with attributes x, y, z and radius and assign them with this.
    Create void surfaceArea method:
        double surfaceArea = 4 * pi * radius
        Print out the area
    Create void Volume method:
        double volume = (4/3) * pi * radius^3
        Print out volume
    Create double distanceFromPoint method:
        double distance = Math.sqrt(Math.pow(x-x2,2) + Math.pow(y-y2,2) + Math.pow(z-z2,2));
        Print out distance
        return distance
    Create void collision method:
    If distance from 1 point to to other is less than radius1 + radius2:
        print that Spheres collide
    else
        print that Spheres do NOT collide;

Main Class:
    Import Scanner Utility
    Initialize scanner for input.
    Initialize objects for the sun, the earth, and planetX using the specified numbers
    Ask for input for the x, y, z, and radius variables for the user create planet.
    Print out the surface area of the sun, and the volume of the sun.
    Print out the surface area of the earth, and the volume of the earth.
    Print out the surface area of the planetx, and the volume of the planetx.
    Check if the sun has collided with earth
    check if the sun has collided with planetx
    check if the earth has collided with planetx
    check if the users planet has collided with the sun
    check if the users planet has collided with earth
    check if the users planet has collided with planetx
